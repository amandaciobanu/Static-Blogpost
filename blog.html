    <h2>Tel Aviv has over 400 Vegan and Vegan-Friendly Restaurants!</h2>
    <p class="first">The “vegan capital of the world” is what proud locals dub Tel Aviv. With 400 vegan and vegan-friendly kitchens catering to most of Israel’s 200,000 
        vegans, going meat-free isn’t just easy, here; it’s a chance to sample the best food in town. Thanks to the sun-kissed climate, 
        high quality fruit and veg is never too far – you can see it in the colour, 
        taste it in the flavour and smell it in the aroma of what’s on your plate.

        <p> In Tel Aviv, “there is a real emphasis on freshness of produce,” says vegan restaurant owner Merav Barzilay. 
        Though he founded Meshek Barzilay on an organic farm 15 years ago, he says it was an easy choice to move to the city. 
        Tel Aviv’s proximity to fresh vegetables “means a customer can eat a tomato the same day it was picked in the field”.

        <h2>59,500 people worldwide, took part in Veganuary</h2>
        <p class="first">As many of you know, Veganuary is a charity that encourages people to give the vegan lifestyle a chance in the month of January.  
            It is reported that they had over 59,500 people participate this year. It has witnessed a whopping increase from just  3,300 participants in their debut year, 2014. Out of the 59,500, approximately 24,000 were carnivores and 15,000 were vegetarian. It is a testimony to the fact that people are willing to change.  Moreover, 
            it was noticed that the main reason of their participation apart from health and environment was the animals. Halleluiah world, 
            we’re proud of you!
        </p>
        <p>The campaign was started in the United Kingdom in 2014 by Jane Land and Matthew Glover, a husband-and-wife team who met on a vegan dating 
            site and were inspired by Movember (growing a mustache for men’s health).
            Participants who pledge to go vegan on the site receive daily recipes, 
            tips and information about how a vegan diet benefits animals, the environment and our bodies.
